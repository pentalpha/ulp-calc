# ulp-calc
Tool for Unit in the Last Place calculation and floating point precision analysis

-----------------------------------------

The ulp-calc tool aims to simplify the absolute and relative error analysis in floating point representations using different amounts of bits.

The software itself consists of the libraries "multi" and "ulp-calc" that implement the necessary functions, the "main.cpp" file that uses
"ulp-calc" and "multi" functions to implement the functionalitys and the script called "build" that, when run, build a executable called ulp-demo that can be used by the user.
